# Main Ansible playbook (site.yml)
# This playbook orchestrates tasks across different host groups.
# Given the Terraform setup (ECS Fargate, S3/CloudFront), this playbook
# might be more focused on CI/CD steps or managing auxiliary hosts (e.g., bastion).

# Example Playbook Structure:

# - name: Apply common configuration to all relevant hosts (e.g., build agents, bastion)
#   hosts: all # Or specific groups like build_agents, bastion_hosts
#   roles:
#     - common

# - name: Deploy Backend (e.g., trigger ECS update via CI/CD pipeline)
#   hosts: localhost # Or build_agents
#   gather_facts: no
#   roles:
#     - role: backend
#       vars:
#         new_task_definition_revision: "{{ lookup("env", "NEW_TASK_REVISION") }}" # Example: Get revision from env var
#   tags:
#     - deploy-backend

# - name: Build and Deploy Frontend (e.g., build, sync to S3, invalidate CloudFront via CI/CD)
#   hosts: localhost # Or build_agents
#   gather_facts: no
#   vars:
#     build_dir: "/path/to/checkout/on/build/agent"
#     frontend_s3_bucket_id: "{{ lookup("env", "FRONTEND_S3_BUCKET") }}"
#     frontend_cloudfront_distribution_id: "{{ lookup("env", "FRONTEND_CF_DIST_ID") }}"
#     backend_api_url: "{{ lookup("env", "BACKEND_API_URL") }}"
#   roles:
#     - role: frontend_web
#   tags:
#     - deploy-frontend
