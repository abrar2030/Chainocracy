# Web Frontend Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive information about the test suite implemented for the web frontend application. The tests are designed to ensure the reliability, functionality, and quality of the application through various testing approaches.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Testing Libraries**: 
  - React Testing Library
  - Jest DOM (for DOM assertions)
  - User Event (for simulating user interactions)

## Test Structure
The test suite is organized into the following categories:

1. **Component Tests**: Tests for individual UI components
2. **Screen Tests**: Tests for complete screen components
3. **Context Tests**: Tests for context providers and hooks
4. **Integration Tests**: Tests for component interactions

## Test Coverage
The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for:
- Rendering of components and screens
- User interactions (clicks, form inputs, etc.)
- State management and updates
- API interactions (mocked)
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

For a visual interface to view test results:

```bash
npm test -- --ui
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Files Overview

### UI Component Tests
- `ui.test.tsx`: Tests for basic UI components like Button, Input, Card, etc.

### Screen Tests
- `AnnounceElection.test.tsx`: Tests for the election announcement screen
- `Blockchain.test.tsx`: Tests for the blockchain overview screen
- `BlockchainDetails.test.tsx`: Tests for the blockchain details screen
- `CandidateDetails.test.tsx`: Tests for the candidate details screen
- `EditAccount.test.tsx`: Tests for the account editing screen
- `ElectionResults.test.tsx`: Tests for the election results screen
- `Entrance.test.tsx`: Tests for the entrance/welcome screen
- `Home.test.tsx`: Tests for the home screen
- `NoPage.test.tsx`: Tests for the 404 page
- `PublicAnnouncement.test.tsx`: Tests for the public announcements screen
- `Voters.test.tsx`: Tests for the voters management screen

### Context Tests
- `AuthContext.test.tsx`: Tests for the authentication context

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Mocking External Dependencies**: All external dependencies (axios, etc.) are properly mocked
2. **Comprehensive Assertions**: Tests verify both UI elements and functionality
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Tests include error states and boundary conditions
4. **User Interaction Testing**: Tests simulate real user interactions
5. **Isolation**: Components are tested in isolation with dependencies mocked

## Maintenance
When adding new features or modifying existing ones, follow these guidelines:
1. Add corresponding tests for new components or screens
2. Update existing tests when modifying components
3. Ensure all tests pass before deploying changes
4. Maintain high test coverage for critical application paths

## Troubleshooting
If tests are failing, check for:
1. Changes in component props or structure
2. Updates to external dependencies
3. Changes in API responses
4. DOM structure modifications

## Conclusion
This test suite provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the web frontend application. By maintaining and extending these tests as the application evolves, you can prevent regressions and ensure new features work as expected.
